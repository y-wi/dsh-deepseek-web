# dsh-deepseek-web

See the repository README for install, models, tools, and security boundaries.

This package is a DeepSeek Harness plugin. It uses DeepSeek Web through a
compatibility layer, is not the official Open Platform adapter, and does not
bypass CAPTCHA/WAF or account access controls.

After browser sign-in, the sidebar footer lists DeepSeek Web conversations. Fork
to Workspace creates an independent Harness session that does not write back to
the original Web conversation. Native search stays on for `default`. `/clean`
is a session toggle that sends only the human text.
